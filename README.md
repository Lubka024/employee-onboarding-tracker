# Employee Onboarding Tracker

## The purpose of your application 
  I want an app to help HR efficiently track and manage the onboarding process for new employees.

## About your application
With Contember, we will build an application to help HR efficiently track and manage the onboarding process for new employees. This application will provide a user-friendly interface for HR personnel to input and manage employee data, track the progress of onboarding tasks, and generate reports. The application will be built using Contember's open-source framework and can be deployed to the Contember Cloud for easy access and usage. Additionally, the code for the application can be downloaded and further customized as needed.

## Roles
### Employee
An Employee is a user role within the application who has access to their own onboarding tasks, personal information, and progress. They can update their personal details, complete assigned tasks, and view their onboarding status.

## User flows
### Admin invites a new employee with relevant details (name, job title, start date, etc.).
Admin creates a new employee profile by entering relevant details such as name, job title, start date, and other necessary information, then sends an invitation to the new employee to join the application.
### Admin assigns onboarding tasks to the new employee
Admin selects the new employee's profile and assigns a list of onboarding tasks to be completed by the employee within the application.
### New employees mark tasks as completed as they progress through their onboarding.
New employees access their assigned tasks within the application and mark each task as completed once they have finished it during their onboarding process.
### Admin tracks the progress of the onboarding process for each new employee, ensuring that all tasks are completed on time.
Admin monitors the onboarding progress of each new employee within the application, checking the completion status of assigned tasks and ensuring they are finished in a timely manner.
### Upon completion of all tasks, the Admin marks the onboarding process as complete for the new employee.
Once all assigned tasks are completed by the new employee, the Admin updates the employee's profile in the application to mark the onboarding process as complete.
### As Admin i want to invite employees via email
Admin enters the new employee's email address while creating their profile and sends an invitation email, allowing the employee to join the application.
